# TITLE: Numbers Game

## DESCRIPTION

Welcome aboard fellow developer! In the Numbers Game, players have the exciting task of picking a number (selecting an option) and trying to guess the correct number with as few attempts as possible. If they pick a number that's too high or too low, they'll get an alert to guide them.

## REAL-WORLD USES

- Puzzles and Brain Teasers: Many puzzle books and mobile apps include number-based guessing games to challenge the player's problem-solving skills.

- Raffles and Lotteries: In some raffle or lottery systems, players need to guess specific numbers to win prizes.

- Psychological Studies: Researchers use similar guessing games in experiments to study decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.

- Market Research: Marketers sometimes use games that involve guessing numbers or predicting outcomes to gather consumer preferences and insights.

- Random Number Generators: Various applications require random number generation, including gaming, cryptography, and simulations.
